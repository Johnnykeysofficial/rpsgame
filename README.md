//My Pseudocode
//firstly get a UI to work with, then delare 3 three buttons (i.e rock, paper, scissors)
//after declaring the buttons,
// assign playerChoice to the button value,
//assign computerChoice to a random value i.e (rock, paper, scissors);
//after the assignment,
//compare their choices according to the game rules for final result i.e
// if playerChoice ==== computerChoice then return draw also update the Draw score on the UI
//else if playerChoice === rock then computerChoice === scissors return Win also update the win score on the UI
//else if playerChoice === scissors then computerChoice === paper return Win also update the win score on the UI
// else if playerChoice === paper then computerChoice === rock return Win also update the win score on the UI
//else return lose also update the lose score on the UI.
//END..
